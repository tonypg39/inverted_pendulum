# inverted_pendulum
In this project we create a enviroment to simulate the inverted pendulum in order to create and test classic control algorithm such as PID 
and cascade PID and machine learning algorithm such as reinformered learning in order to archieve some task like:
1-keep the pendulum in balance(PID)
2-Set a constant speed keeping the pendulum in balance(cascade PID)
3-Let the robot go to a 1D point(triple cascade PID)
4-The robot learns to perform the above tasks using reinforced learning
This simulator was created in order to built a real self balancing robot,
the enviroment was developed using angular 6 as client and python3 flask as server and there is a version with html5 and javascripts
