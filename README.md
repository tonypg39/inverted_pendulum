# inverted_pendulum
In this project we created an environment to simulate the inverted pendulum to create and test classic control algorithms such as PID
, Cascaded PID and machine learning algorithm, such as reinforcement learning, to archive some tasks such as:
1-keep the pendulum in equilibrium (PID)
2-Establish a constant speed keeping the pendulum in equilibrium (cascading PID)
3-Let the robot go to a point 1D (triple cascade PID)
4-The robot learns to perform the previous tasks using reinforcement learning
This simulator was created in order to build a real self balancing robot,
the environment was developed using angle 6 as client and python3 flask as server and there is a version with html5, javascripts and JQuery.
Inside the folder of inv_pend (Angular 6) follow the instructions to execute the program
